# Abstract
This essay, *The Century Shaken: A Note on the Collapse of Marx, Rand, and Materialism*, continues the arc begun in *Hidden Kinship Between Marx and Rand*. It argues that Marxism, Objectivism, and secular materialism collapse retroactively at inception because each denies the irreducible inner world of imagination, faith, art, and thought—the very realities they must tap into to construct their own ideologies. By exposing this denial as self‑defeating, the essay shows how these systems fail their promise of liberation and instead rest on foundations already undone.

In contrast to prior critiques, this work introduces the **Universal Principle of Collapse**: any ideology that excludes the inner world is invalid from the start. This paper is the second in a three‑part series, with subsequent essays continuing the arc and deepening the implications for philosophy, culture, and human freedom. The work proceeds in a narrative voice, reflecting the irreducible inner world it defends.

# The Irreducible Inner World
Objections remain rhetorical only; in reality, the irreducible inner world cannot be denied without presupposing it. Any counterargument relies on the very consciousness it seeks to dismiss. Some would attempt escape, assuming the arguments here request adherence to a faith. That is not the case. Instead, they are called to recognize reality as observed. And if they still decline, they do so interpreting and deciding using the same source—consciousness itself.

# A Note on the Collapse
This essay exposes more than a century of ideological error. The implications are catastrophic, and the term *collapse* is used to mark the scale of devastation. The deeper one looks, the more wreckage appears.

I wrote *Hidden Kinship* Sunday last, and at that moment, everything changed. The argument marked a decisive shift. It stands whether ignored or engaged, for there is no escape from what is self‑evident. The implications arise as the mind internalizes what has already occurred. And it came out of the dirt and muck, outside institutional curation, from the inner world of the mind. That description suffices.

No contempt for institutions is intended. It is reason itself that implicates, and I am content to follow where logic leads, while acknowledging the complexity of human nature.

This essay critiques Marxism, Objectivism, and secular materialism, with implications that are systemic.

To bridge the argument, readers are directed to the original essay *Hidden Kinship Between Marx and Rand*.

# The Artist and the Inner World
Marxism, Objectivism, and materialism may permit the artist—and indeed they do. Yet the artist reflects the inner world of dreams, imagination, and faith, an irreducible reality. This is observably and logically evident, so much so that sourcing it is little more than clerical paperwork.

All three pillars were invalid at inception, undone the moment their first words were penned. Each structure erected in the name of Marxism, Objectivism, or materialism required conception and design—realities that dwell in the grey of the mind, until inner vision moves from dream to material completion. Yet these systems reject the inner world as irreducible, severing it at spirituality and thereby collapsing their own constructs. Their absolutism attempts to void ideas that do not conform, even though such ideas are sourced in the inner mind itself.

Music is permitted, but to what end? The arts are employed as instruments to affirm ideology, to rally, to direct culture, while ignoring the irreducible origins of song and its profound effects within humanity. Marx, Rand, and materialists broadly cannot but evidence and affirm this essay in retrospect, from the moment they first thought. For thought itself is irreducible, and thought produces faith and artistic expression.

# To Recap
Marxism, Objectivism, and secular materialism all collapse before they begin because their own existence depends on imagination, art, and faith—which they deny.

I offered clarity not through faith‑based argumentation but through observable reality and philosophy. The implications affirm spirituality as sound.

Here the point must be sharpened: Marx, Rand, and materialism did not merely ignore consciousness; they exploited fragments of it while cutting off imagination, faith, and wonder to suit their visions. Their collapse was immediate, retroactive at inception, because their claims of human freedom rested on denying the very inner world they employed. Faith is not a leap from thought but integral to freedom itself, as natural and self‑evident as water, earth, and sky, attested by humanity’s rituals and symbols across history.

As far as I can find, this has never been argued. What was written last Sunday collapses over a century of thought, with implications far greater than those set down here.

The irony is devastating: for over a century, people believed in these systems while relying on imagination, art, and thought—the irreducible realities those systems deny. They built their faith on scaffolding already cracked.

# Counterfactual History
Possibly, had *Hidden Kinship Between Marx and Rand* existed in the early 20th century, during the rise of communism and fascism, it might have forced an earlier reckoning, stripping those movements of legitimacy and altering the course of history itself. This is not a claim of certainty but a reflection on possibility. The absence of such a reckoning allowed these ideologies to entrench themselves, shaping a century of devastation.

We can entertain the thought at least. And thinking is the point. The mind wanders and wonders. That’s real and observable.

---

# Ultimate Subjectivity
The concept of ultimate subjectivity—the irreducible fact that all thought begins in consciousness—was glimpsed by opponents of fascism and communism but never applied decisively. Here it is wielded without compromise, collapsing Marx, Rand, and materialism together.

This essay is the first to weaponize it fully, collapsing Marx, Rand, and materialism together, since each relied upon imagination and subjectivity at the core of their visions. Whether knowingly or by hallucinating what they assumed or wished was reason, they were undone from the moment they began. For reason is sought in the irreducible mind.

The irony is exposed. I say this clearly, and firmly.

The logic is self‑evident: to process this paper at all, one must think, and thinking itself requires the irreducible inner world of imagination. Even those who read and interpret the essay otherwise than intended are, by default, employing the very inner world they would deny.

# The Reckoning
From this moment forward, the reckoning is inevitable, sooner or later. I walked the wilderness thinking I was alone. Others lived in parallels, with wondrous constructs, civilization, objects, and apparent stability. But they were diluted in a fever dream. And the desert as I walked and knew it was reality. The inner world and the outer world, God, and what was lost, restored.

I saw their world collapsed, the three pillars scattered on the sands of time, devastated. The construct of the three—irrational, illusions.

Welcome to the Era of Restoration. Philosophy has returned to its foundations.

By conjuring poetry and story, along with well‑earned collapse, I confound what was, and open the gates to what’s infinite, observable, logical, and sound. The irreducible inner world and the external need no permission, and never did.

# Cottage in the Woods
Because within the rigidity of facts, we navigate the in‑between — that which is and what is not — allowing for transitions, as paint upon a canvas. Without paint, there is only canvas. Reference and contrast are needed to identify and know the differences between things. Existence. Error is a feature, not a mistake, but a journey. Brush strokes. And as a result, we witness movement and meaning. Stillness has meaning too. And meaning is.

There is nothing else but meaning. We observe from within, and out into the world. We stare inside as well. Within ourselves, we imagine and ponder, and that exists, irreducibly.

Open the windows of your cottage in the woods. Notice the greens and blues, the critters and birds, the path that leads into wilderness, then forking and branching like the canopy of trees above your head.

To wander and wonder.

# The Century Shaken: Revisiting the Graveyard
Marxism once dominated political and philosophical thought across the 20th century, shaping revolutions, governments, and intellectual life in Europe and postcolonial societies. Yet its refusal to account for spirituality and the inner world leaves it buried among the century’s ruins. What was hailed as liberation collapses at its foundation, and one of the century’s most influential frameworks lies undone.

Objectivism, Rand’s creed, though less academically entrenched, carried enormous cultural weight in America. It inspired libertarian politics, capitalist ideals, and a vision of the heroic individual. But by overturning her central claim about autonomy, I have shown its foundations to be hollow. Its tomb lies beside Marxism’s, another pillar fallen in the graveyard of ideas.

Materialist secularism stood as the backbone of analytic philosophy, positivism, and secular humanism. It promised clarity by grounding reality in matter alone. Yet by denying the inner world, it denied observable reality itself. This grave is the deepest, for materialism claimed universality while excluding the irreducible truths of imagination, faith, and thought.

# Why Collapse and the Scandal of Logic
Each of these traditions claimed to liberate humanity, yet their denial of the inner world made them self‑defeating. Their collapse was retroactive, invalidating their origins as well as their outcomes. The century is shaken, the scaffolding is rubble, and the reckoning cannot be delayed. The Restoration has begun.

Throughout the last century, many thinkers tried to weaken the pillars of Marxism, Objectivism, and materialism. Karl Popper dismissed Marxism as unfalsifiable, Friedrich Hayek attacked collectivism, phenomenologists like Heidegger and Merleau‑Ponty emphasized lived experience, and postmodernists such as Foucault and Derrida dismantled grand narratives. Yet none achieved collapse at inception.

My own path did not consciously draw from these figures or their critiques. If their ideas reached me, it was only indirectly, through the currents of culture. I walked the path of logic itself, recursively, disinterested nor tempted to compromise. And that, all things considered, is scandalous, because logic alone, pursued without concession, collapses what millions believed unshakable.

# The Universal Principle of Collapse
**Definition:** The Universal Principle of Collapse states that any ideology or system which denies the irreducible inner world of imagination, faith, art, and thought collapses retroactively at inception, because its own existence depends upon the very realities it seeks to exclude.

This principle is not explored in detail here, but its definition is established. A fuller treatment will follow in subsequent work.
