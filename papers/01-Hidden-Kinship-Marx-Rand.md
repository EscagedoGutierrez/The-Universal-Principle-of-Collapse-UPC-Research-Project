### Abstract
This essay identifies a neglected kinship between Karl Marx and Ayn Rand: both reject the supernatural, thereby minimizing fundamental human tendencies and constraining individual autonomy in one of humanity’s oldest domains. While their ideological opposition has been extensively documented, scholarship has overlooked how their shared secular absolutism aligns them in limiting freedom. By situating this denial of transcendence and lived experience as a common thread, the essay destabilizes—and ultimately collapses—three major pillars of modern 
thought: Marxism, Objectivism, and materialist secularism.

### Introduction
In this essay I weave together a meta‑critique: despite their ideological differences, both Rand and Marx restrict individual autonomy by declaring the supernatural illegitimate. Their hidden kinship lies in secular absolutism, a stance that constrains freedom in one of humanity’s oldest domains. 

While Marx’s secularism has been widely critiqued and Rand’s anti‑faith stance thoroughly documented, no comparative study has yet framed their shared denial of the supernatural as a constraint on autonomy and, ultimately, as a rejection of lived reality. 

This essay seeks to fill that gap, and in doing so, exposes the collapse of three pillars of modern thought: Marxism, Objectivism, and materialist secularism.

### Rand and Marx’s Position 
For Rand, autonomy is rational and secular. Faith in a Creator is not only dismissed as irrational but condemned as surrender of the mind. Objectivism insists that reason alone defines freedom, closing off the inner world as illegitimate. 

For Marx, autonomy is materialist and historical. Religion is reduced to “opium of the people,” a narcotic that clouds awareness and sustains oppression. In his view, faith is false consciousness, a barrier to liberation through class struggle. 

### The Hidden Kinship
Scholars have compared Rand and Marx on ethics, politics, and economics, but their hidden 
kinship lies in a deeper denial: both restrict autonomy and reject reality itself by dismissing the 
supernatural.
 
I challenge both Rand’s claim to defend autonomy and Marx’s claim to liberate humanity. In rejecting the supernatural, they deny a fundamental dimension of human freedom and experience, collapsing theirsecular absolutism.
 
This hidden kinship reveals a paradox: philosophies built to champion freedom instead constrain it in one of humanity’s most fundamental domains, the search for the divine. 

The paradox persists because human life resists reduction. Humanity operates as individual nodes of complexity, each carrying values and conclusions that manifest through interactions with the world outside. 

### The Role of Spirituality and Religion
Spirituality and religion, whether dismissed as irrational or illegitimate, remain constants across history and pre‑history, inseparable from reality as observed. Belief in the supernatural is woven into the fabric of individuals and the societies they build.
 
By rejecting faith and religion, Rand and Marx deny these obvious aspects of reality and the individual’s full autonomy, the freedom to choose. They lean on materialism to fill the gap, a gap they might dismiss as irrelevant or harmful. Yet as I will show, it is a gap they cannot secure or replace.

### Materialism vs. the Inner World 
The distinction between materialism and the complex internal world of the mind to include the apparent randomness and complexity of emotions, dreams, and the human insistence in questioning the unknown, is the grey area that both Rand and Marx ultimately reject.
 
Some might argue they allow for inner life, but only within rigid lines and imposed values. Their logic? Internal reckoning. While they map their ideological conclusions, those exclude a fundamental that cannot be separated from humanity.
 
Wherever there is wonder, there is faith, or at least the potential for faith. Or, if that is not to someone’s liking, the choice to wonder. And it surfaces, while messy, depending on the lens one is observing through. Belief is integral across all areas of life, throughout history. Across every domain of human activity, all categories are bound together like a web, and faith is always part of that weave. 

### Example: The Act of Eating
Consider the act of eating. It is never simply the act itself, but always embedded in wider contexts. But in order to claim it's a simple act, which is true in a tentative way, one must cut off all else that’s connected in some fashion or another. One does not simply eat. A person eats in the context of everything else.
 
The food itself has origins, animal, fruit, or vegetable, each adding layers to the act of eating.
 
Where one eats, alone or with others, in a house, tavern, or inn, ties the act to community and place. Perhaps a village, town, or city? What is the name of the town? And the names of others that live in it? What is their relation to the one that’s eating? 

What we’re doing here is mapping what is, and it’s endless, apparently. Let’s just say we could spend a lifetime defining all that exists and that’s observable. Perhaps rejection of that would be acceptable or reasonable for Rand and Marx, until we plot human behavior, and their insistence in spirituality. And looking closely, spirituality surfaces: prayers before meals, churches in towns, relationships formed, and weddings performed in sacred places of worship.
 
What is irrational to Rand and Marx ignores society as it is and has been. Taken to extremes, in practice, and observable, even totalitarian systems, be they fascist or communist, belief and spirituality persisted.
 
Thus, even in the most ordinary acts, or tenuous conditions, spirituality surfaces, showing that Rand and Marx’s rejection of the supernatural is a rejection of reality itself.

### Religion and Conflict 
Some argue that religion, belief, and spirituality cause great conflict and suffering. I welcome that critique, but only if it includes other domains that produce conflict. I would demand examples, and then contrast them to show that suffering arises across all human categories.
 
The potential for harm, whether intended or not, occupies all spaces in which humans exist and interact. Harm is often unintended: even actions meant for good can trigger chains of events with opposite outcomes.
 
Exploitation exists in religion, yes, but equally in finance, commerce, government, science, medicine, and philosophy. It rests at the feet of Rand and Marx as well, because all these domains are bound together in the material and conceptual world we inhabit.

### Mixed Use Instead of Absolutes 
Complexity endures, however difficult it may be for some to accept. Faith is embedded so deeply that common dismissals, calling spirituality nonsensical or harmful, collapse under scrutiny. Unless evidencing a claim through specific arguments, spirituality holds validity as a practice, in the way everything else a conscious being has access to.
 
The inner world of the mind is fluid, integrating concepts materialism cannot capture. In other words, the mind uses the material world in order to express and transmit what is within. We use language and writing, music and dance, to express and communicate. But those tools, such as writing and other forms of idea exchanges, are summaries of a deeper internal constellation of thoughts and emotions. And each individual contains unique-to-them experiences.
 
As for the rigid thinking often reached concerning spirituality: is it not the case that humanity has advanced due to thinkers that both produced inventions and held faith at the same time?
 
Consider Isaac Newton, who formulated the laws of motion and gravity while writing extensively on theology. Or Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, whose monastic life shaped his experiments with pea plants.
 
And others: Astronomer Johannes Kepler, mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal, Nobel Prize–winning physicist Arthur Compton, Leonardo da Vinci, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Florence Nightingale, and many others.
 
How does the Materialist, the Marxist, and the Objectivist work around this mixed use of science and faith? Would it be the case that advances are kept, while stripping the originator of their beliefs? Would there be an invention at all without the totality from whom an advance came in the first place?
 
To claim these discoveries would have emerged without faith is to ground oneself in an alternate reality, not the one history has given us. All that came before arrived at us with all that humans entertained and believed across history.

### Human Nodes and Complexity

Human nodes cluster around shared incentives and beliefs, forming categories such as churches, guilds, and governments. Farmers, builders, warriors, from these clusters, societies emerge.
 
Yet these categories are only placeholders for deeper complexity within each human node. Individuals rarely conform neatly to the definitions assigned to them, because such labels simplify what is far more intricate: the inner world of the living being. 

### Binary Conclusions and Reality
Rigid conclusions about the supernatural, as Rand and Marx attempt to impose, reject reality itself, reducing what is expansive and undeniable into artificial order.
 
Humans seek the divine across eras, despite modern thinkers rejecting the practice. History and human behavior tell a different story.

### Conclusion

In their secular absolutism, Rand and Marx deny reality itself, collapsing freedom at its 
foundation.
 
Some may argue they only deny the supernatural aspects of humanity, but that defense collapses when carried to its ultimate conclusion, and collapses again each time it is pressed further.
 
My arguments herein collapse the foundations of Marxism, Objectivism, and materialist secularism at their core claim of liberation.
 
Marxism claims liberation through material conditions, dismissing religion as false consciousness. Yet spirituality persists even under suppression, exposing Marx’s framework as unable to account for lived reality.
 
Objectivism claims autonomy through reason alone, dismissing faith as irrational. Yet rejecting faith restricts autonomy, flipping Rand’s central claim upside down.
 
Materialism claims reality is only matter, dismissing spirit as illusion. Yet the inner world of wonder, dreams, emotions, and faith, is irreducible, exposing materialism as a denial of observable reality.
 
Three ideologies, each claiming to free humanity, paradoxically constrain it by denying the supernatural. In exposing this hidden kinship, I have shown their absolutism to be self‑defeating, and their foundations of liberation to be illusions.
