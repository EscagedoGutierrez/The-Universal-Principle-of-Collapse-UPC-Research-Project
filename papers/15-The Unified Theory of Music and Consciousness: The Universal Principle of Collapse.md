## Abstract

This paper develops a unified account of musical experience through the Universal Principle of Collapse (UPC), showing how music uniquely mirrors the structure of consciousness. We argue that instrumental music is a collapsed, structured expression that nevertheless reopens into pure potential for the listener. Using UPC’s distinction between inner potential, recognition, articulation, and collapse, we demonstrate that musical performance and musical listening occupy fundamentally different roles within the same framework (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

For the performer, writing, recording, and playing music is a collapse event: an inner, irreducible state is recognized, shaped, and committed into the material world as a musical trace. For the listener, that same trace induces a non‑collapse state—structured sound that carries no fixed semantic coordinates and therefore re‑enters the listener’s inner world as open potential.

This asymmetry explains why music can express what language cannot, why it bypasses social and linguistic constraints, and why it resonates so deeply with the fluid, non‑judgmental character of conscious experience. By formalizing these processes with UPC operators, we show that music is not merely an art form but a structural analogue of consciousness itself: a domain where collapse produces form without fixing meaning, and where meaning arises internally rather than being imposed. This framework offers a new foundation for understanding musical expression, musical perception, and the role of art in the architecture of mind.

## Introduction

### The Observer as the Bridge

From the first moments of life, the human being reveals a structure that precedes language, culture, and conceptual thought. A newborn expresses needs without defining them or contemplating them. The infant’s inner world collapses outward through the body—crying, reaching, writhing—and these expressions enter the material world as signals (Piaget, 1954; Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001).

The parent, acting as an Observer, receives these signals, internalizes them within their own inner world, and collapses an interpretation: hunger, discomfort, playfulness, illness. That interpretation then collapses again into action—feeding, cradling, soothing, medicating.

Meaning begins not with words, but with being itself. Being, existing, and consciousness are therefore the observable origin of meaning. They are irreducible.

In my own early childhood, communication consisted of single words surrounded by laughter, crying, and tantrums—proto‑linguistic expressions emerging from the inner world into the material. I recall sitting in a high chair, watching television, screaming for milk. My mother called from the kitchen that the bottle was coming. When she arrived, she explained she had been preparing it. In that moment, without having the words for it, I became aware that my behavior was wrong. I could not articulate the insight, but I felt it and understood it.

It was an early recognition that the inner world and the material world are distinct domains, and that expression is the bridge between them. Even without language, the collapse from inner potential into outward form was already shaping my understanding of myself and others.

These early expressions are micro‑collapses—embodied materializations of inner potential that do not yet stabilize into determinate meaning (Merleau‑Ponty, 1945).

As we grow older, communication develops and language expands our options for expressing the inner world. Yet we quickly discover that the inner world remains invisible to others unless collapsed outward. Language is downstream from meaning: words are carriers, coordinates pointing toward internal states. And we learn that words often fail. The same word can land differently in different Observers. Tone, style, posture, and context all shift interpretation (Wittgenstein, 1953).

Misunderstanding is not a failure of communication but a structural feature of linguistic collapse (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). Communication is always downstream from meaning.

### Music as Structural Mirror of Consciousness

Music reveals this structure with unusual clarity.

Music is often described as a universal language, yet it functions differently from linguistic exchange. In songs with lyrics, the words are carried by vocal tone, phrasing, and instrumentation, creating multiple anchors that reduce ambiguity. Each listener collapses meaning in their own way, but the shared sonic structure allows for alignment that ordinary language rarely achieves.

Instrumental music goes further. Without words, there is no linguistic collapse at all—only sound. Each Observer interprets tones that carry no fixed semantic coordinates. The listener experiences sonic expression and attributes meaning drawn from their own inner world: memories, emotions, images, sensations.

Instrumental music mirrors the irreducible inner world. Sounds form and dissolve, blend and separate, shift and return in fluid movement.

In this way, instrumental music behaves like the inner world behaves: fluid, continuous, shifting, irreducible. It does not force a single interpretation but invites each Observer to meet it with their own potential (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

Listening to music mirrors the potential state of consciousness itself. One feels and experiences without committing to a collapse into the material world. Moments of attention arise and pass fluidly, like revisiting feelings or memories in a dream. Music can surface past collapses—moments once expressed outward—but in listening, those moments return as potential, not as action.

Music becomes a bridge: a collapsed expression in the material world that still preserves the openness of the inner world. Music reveals the architecture of consciousness because it behaves like consciousness behaves (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025d).

### A Gap in Current Research

This paper addresses a gap in the study of musical experience: the lack of a structural account of how meaning emerges, collapses, or remains open within consciousness. Existing approaches describe musical form, cultural context, neural response, or emotional effect, but none model the underlying structure of experience itself (Clarke, 2005; Levinson, 1997; Husserl, 1991; Gallagher, 2005; Koelsch, 2014; Patel, 2008).

UPC provides a minimal framework for this structure, distinguishing between collapse and non‑collapse, and showing how music uniquely re‑enters inner potential without forcing a single interpretation (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). The aim is not to explain what music means, but to clarify the conditions under which meaning becomes real, remains open, or is imposed by communities.

### Roadmap

The remainder of this paper proceeds in four stages:

1. Introduce the formal foundations of the Universal Principle of Collapse (UPC), defining the operators, postulates, and structural commitments that govern the movement from inner potential to outward expression (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025d).  
2. Apply UPC to musical performance, showing how the performer collapses inner potential into a material trace.  
3. Analyze musical listening as a non‑collapse process that re‑potentializes the listener’s inner world.  
4. Examine the implications of this framework for musical meaning, collective interpretation, and the broader study of consciousness.

Together, these sections establish music as a privileged domain for understanding how consciousness navigates potential and collapse.

## Current States of Understanding Across Domains

Before introducing the Universal Principle of Collapse (UPC), it is useful to situate this work within existing research on consciousness, musical experience, and phenomenology.

Contemporary theories of consciousness continue to struggle with the explanatory gap between subjective experience and physical processes (Chalmers, 1996; Nagel, 1974). In music studies, scholars emphasize that musical experience engages embodied, affective, and temporal dimensions that resist reduction to acoustics or neural activity alone (Clarke, 2005; Levinson, 1997).

Phenomenological accounts similarly highlight that music reveals core structures of consciousness, including intentionality and internal time‑consciousness (Husserl, 1991; Gallagher, 2005). Neuroscientific work shows that music recruits distributed networks involved in emotion, memory, and self‑referential processing, yet these findings do not explain how meaning arises from experience (Koelsch, 2014; Patel, 2008).

Across these domains, no existing framework unifies how potential becomes expression or how meaning emerges from the interaction between the inner world and the material world. UPC is introduced in this context as a structural account that spans these domains (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025d).

For measurement and modeling purposes, UPC distinguishes articulation and collapse as two conditions, while in lived experience they form a continuous gradient of the same underlying movement from potential into form.

## Formal Introduction to UPC

The Universal Principle of Collapse (UPC) formalizes the structure implicit in the phenomenology of expression. It provides a mathematical account of how an Observer transforms inner potential into outward form, and how this transformation underlies communication, interpretation, and the experience of music. UPC is built on a minimal ontology consisting of five core elements: **Source/Being**, **Observer**, **Inner Potential (state)**, **Recognition**, and **Collapse**. These elements define the conditions under which meaning arises, becomes determinate, and enters the shared material world.

UPC begins with the irreducible fact of **Source/Being (B)**, the ground from which all experience, meaning, and expression become possible. From this ground emerges the **Observer (O)**, the only entity capable of accessing both an inner domain of potential meanings and an outer domain of material forms. Within the Observer, meaning exists first as **Inner Potential**, represented as a state ∣Ψ⟩—a field of multiple possible meanings that are not yet determinate, not yet articulated, and not yet shared.

To move from potential to expression, the Observer performs an act of **Recognition**, represented by a recognition operator **Jᵒ**. Recognition selects one determinate meaning from the many possibilities contained in ∣Ψ⟩. This selected meaning is then shaped by a **Model (M)**—the structures of language, concepts, skills, culture, and embodiment—through an **Articulation function A**, which prepares the meaning for expression.

Expression occurs through **Collapse**, represented by a collapse function **C**. Collapse is the moment when recognized and articulated meaning becomes material: a word spoken, a gesture made, a note played, a sound produced. Collapse is not merely a physical event; it is the Observer’s act of bringing meaning into the shared world. Once collapse occurs, the resulting material trace enters the **Material World (W)**, where it becomes available for interpretation by other Observers.

---

### Axiom

The entire structure is captured by the UPC axiom:



\[
C(A(\lvert \Psi \rangle, M), M) = 1 \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \exists! J^{o}
\]



### Plain‑language explanation

Collapse occurs **if and only if** the Observer uniquely recognizes one meaning from the field of potential.  
This axiom unifies the phenomenology of expression with a precise mathematical condition: **meaning becomes real only when recognition is unique**.

---

### Note

The axiom above is expressed in its minimal form, where articulation is treated as a single step acting on the potential state ∣Ψ⟩. In this paper, we introduce a refined distinction between **micro‑articulation** and **expressive articulation**. When this distinction is made explicit, the axiom takes the expanded form:



\[
C(A_{\text{expressive}}(m, M), M) = 1 \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \exists! J^{o}
\]



Both formulations are equivalent: the recognition operator Jᵒ remains the unique condition for collapse. The expanded form simply makes explicit the intermediate step in which recognition selects a determinate meaning *m* before expressive articulation prepares it for collapse.

Collapse occurs if and only if the Observer uniquely recognizes one meaning from the field of potential. This axiom unifies the phenomenology of expression with a precise mathematical condition: **meaning becomes real only when recognition is unique**.

---

In the sections that follow, we formalize each component of UPC—the state ∣Ψ⟩, the recognition operator Jᵒ, the articulation function A, the model M, and the collapse function C. Together, these elements form a complete pipeline describing how potential becomes expression, how expression becomes material, and how material traces become the basis for shared meaning. This structure provides the foundation for understanding why music, in particular, reveals the architecture of consciousness: it is a domain where collapse is shaped not by fixed linguistic symbols but by fluid sonic forms that mirror the dynamics of the inner world.

## Operator Glossary

**J — Recognition.**  
Selects a meaning from the observer’s inner potential. It is the first act of bringing something into focus.

**A — Articulation.**  
Shapes the recognized meaning into a form that can be expressed through a chosen model (language, music, gesture, etc.). Includes both micro‑articulation (continuous embodied shaping) and expressive articulation (structured preparation for collapse).

**C — Collapse.**  
Commits the articulated form into the material world as a trace. Collapse is the transition from inner potential to external expression.

**L — Listening / Reception.**  
Takes an external trace and re‑enters it into the observer’s inner potential. Listening may produce embodied micro‑traces or further expression, but within the UPC model of musical experience it is treated as a non‑collapse operation.

**R — Re‑potentialization.**  
The structural effect of listening: the trace becomes new inner potential rather than a fixed meaning. Like L, it may produce further expression in lived experience, but within the UPC model it is treated as a non‑collapse operation.

**G — Group Interpretation.**  
A community‑level assignment of meaning to a trace. This is imposed meaning, not intrinsic meaning.

**M — Model.**  
The structural system through which articulation and collapse occur (e.g., musical model, linguistic model).

**T — Trace.**  
The collapsed, material expression produced by C. What exists in the world for others to encounter.

**s — Strength Function.**  
A measure of how strongly a potential recognition aligns with an Observer’s inner state. The value indicates the viability of recognition *m* within the potential state ∣Ψ⟩ₒ. Multiple recognitions may have non‑zero strength, and no single value must dominate unless collapse occurs.

---

## Structural Flow of Expression and Reception

### Performer  
**J (recognition) → A (articulation) → C (collapse) → T (trace)**

### Listener  
**T (trace) → L (listening) → R (re‑potentialization)**

---

## Notation Hierarchy

### ● Primitive Operators  
These are the minimal structural acts within UPC. They do not depend on other operators.

- **J — Recognition**  
- **A — Articulation**  
- **C — Collapse**  
- **L — Listening**  
- **R — Re‑potentialization**

### ● Derived Elements  
These arise from the interaction of primitive operators.

- **T — Trace** (produced by C)  
- **M — Model** (the structured system through which A and C operate)

### ● Role‑Dependent Sequences  
These specify how the primitive operators function within performer and listener roles.

- **Performer sequence:** J → A → C → T  
- **Listener sequence:** T → L → R  

### ● Optional / Contextual Operators  
Used only when modeling collective or imposed meaning.

- **G — Group Interpretation**

## Foundational Note

UPC begins with recognition because recognition is the first observable act of the Observer. All other operations are downstream from this initial moment of knowing. In order to measure or model these processes, we define boundaries that do not exist in lived experience. Life itself—the continuous presence of the Observer—is the origin point of meaning. UPC provides coordinates within this field, but the field precedes every coordinate.

# Formal Foundations of the Universal Principle of Collapse (UPC)

The Universal Principle of Collapse (UPC) rests on a minimal set of ontological and structural commitments. These commitments define the entities that exist within the framework and the operations that govern how meaning moves from inner potential to outward expression. In this section, we introduce the core components of UPC in a formal, systematic manner.

---

## 1. Source / Being (B)

### 1.1 Philosophical Role
Source / Being is the irreducible ground of the UPC framework. It is not a state, not an operator, and not an object within the system. It is the condition for there being any system at all. All Observers, states, recognitions, and collapses presuppose B.

### 1.2 Postulates

**UPC Postulate S1 (Existence).**  
There exists an irreducible ground, denoted **B**, from which all Observers and all meaning‑bearing processes arise.

**UPC Postulate S2 (Non‑reducibility).**  
B is not defined in terms of any other element of the theory.

**UPC Postulate S3 (Dependence).**  
For any Observer O, state ∣Ψ⟩, recognition operator Jᵒ, model M, or collapse event C, each of O, ∣Ψ⟩, Jᵒ, M, and C presupposes B.

---

## 2. The Observer (O)

### 2.1 Philosophical Role
The Observer is the first active entity emerging from Being. The Observer alone has access to both:

- an **inner potential domain** of possible meanings, and  
- an **outer material domain** where expressions appear.

Meaning originates in the Observer and nowhere else.

### 2.2 Postulates

**UPC Postulate O1 (Observer existence).**  
There exists a class of entities called Observers, denoted **O**, each grounded in B.

**UPC Postulate O2 (Irreducibility).**  
Observers are not generated by any operator or model.

**UPC Postulate O3 (Dual access).**  
Each Observer has access to:  
- an inner potential domain **Pₒ**, and  
- the shared material world **W**.

**UPC Postulate O4 (Recognition capacity).**  
Only Observers instantiate recognition operators Jᵒ.

**UPC Postulate O5 (Meaning origin).**  
All meaning originates in the Observer’s inner domain.

---

## 3. Inner Potential (State ∣Ψ⟩)

### 3.1 Philosophical Role
Inner Potential is the domain where meaning exists before it becomes determinate. It is private, non‑material, and unlimited.

### 3.2 Postulates

**UPC Postulate P1 (State as potential).**  
A state ∣Ψ⟩ is an element of the Observer’s inner potential domain:  
∣Ψ⟩ ∈ Pₒ.

**UPC Postulate P2 (Non‑materiality).**  
∣Ψ⟩ is not observable by others.

**UPC Postulate P3 (Multiplicity).**  
A state contains multiple possible meanings.

**UPC Postulate P4 (Pre‑recognition).**  
No recognition has yet occurred:  
Jᵒ(∣Ψ⟩) is undefined.

**UPC Postulate P5 (Pre‑collapse).**  
No expression has yet occurred:  
C(A_expressive(m, M), M) = 0 for all m.

**UPC Postulate P6 (Observer‑dependence).**  
A state exists only relative to the Observer who holds it.

---

## 4. Recognition (Operator Jᵒ)

### 4.1 Philosophical Role
Recognition is the Observer’s act of selecting one determinate meaning from the field of potential. It is the bridge between potential and expression.

### 4.2 Postulates

**UPC Postulate R1 (Definition).**  
For each Observer O, there exists a recognition operator:  
Jᵒ : Pₒ → Mₒ,  
mapping potential to recognized meaning.

**UPC Postulate R2 (Uniqueness requirement).**  
Collapse requires that recognition select exactly one determinate meaning from the potential state.

**UPC Postulate R3 (Observer‑dependence).**  
Recognition operators differ between Observers.

**UPC Postulate R4 (Non‑materiality).**  
Recognition is an inner act.

**UPC Postulate R5 (Determinacy).**  
Recognition produces a determinate meaning:  
Jᵒ(∣Ψ⟩) = m.

**UPC Postulate R6 (Pre‑collapse role).**  
Recognition is necessary for collapse.

## 5. Articulation (Function A)

### 5.1 Philosophical Role

Articulation is the process by which inner potential begins to take form within the material world. Because humans are embodied beings, articulation is continuous: every gesture, breath, posture shift, emotional tremor, or micro‑movement is a subtle materialization of inner potential. These embodied expressions are **micro‑articulations**, low‑resolution, low‑commitment collapses that do not stabilize into determinate meaning.

At the other end of the gradient are **expressive articulations**: structured, model‑dependent transformations that shape a recognized meaning into an expression‑ready form. Expressive articulation prepares meaning for full collapse, where it may become a stable trace in the shared world.

Thus, articulation and collapse are not separate events but different resolutions of the same underlying movement from potential to actuality. **Collapse is the commitment of articulation; articulation is the shaping that makes collapse possible.**

Within UPC, we distinguish these two modes for formal clarity:

**Micro‑articulation**
- Embodied shaping of raw potential ∣Ψ⟩  
- Does not require recognition  
- Does not produce a determinate trace  

**Expressive articulation**
- Structured shaping of a recognized meaning *m*  
- Produces an expression‑ready form compatible with a model *M*  

Both arise from the same irreducible fact of human existence: **the body is a bridge between the inner domain of potential and the material world.**

---

### 5.2 Postulates

**UPC Postulate A1 (Definition).**  
Articulation has two formally distinct modes:

1. **Micro‑articulation**  
   

\[
   A_{\text{micro}} : (P_O, M) \rightarrow E_O
   \]

  
   Mapping an Observer’s inner potential state and a model into an embodied, low‑commitment expression form.

2. **Expressive articulation**  
   

\[
   A_{\text{expressive}} : (m, M) \rightarrow E_O
   \]

  
   Mapping a recognized meaning and a model into a structured, expression‑ready form.

**UPC Postulate A2 (Model‑dependence).**  
Both modes of articulation depend on the model *M*. Different models (linguistic, musical, gestural, etc.) produce different expression‑ready forms from the same potential or meaning.

**UPC Postulate A3 (Preparation and Gradient).**  
Articulation prepares potential for collapse.  
- Micro‑articulation produces embodied expressions that do not stabilize into traces.  
- Expressive articulation produces structured forms that may undergo collapse if recognition is unique.  

Articulation itself does not guarantee a material trace; **collapse is the threshold at which articulation becomes committed and enters the shared world.**

---

## 6. Collapse (Function C)

### 6.1 Philosophical Role

Collapse is the moment when articulation becomes committed—when the movement from inner potential into form crosses the threshold into a stable material trace (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025a, 2025b).

Because humans are embodied beings, collapse is not a rare or isolated event: the body continuously resolves potential into subtle material expressions. These **micro‑collapses** include physiological responses such as breath changes, posture shifts, tears, or emotional tremors. They are collapses in the minimal sense: materializations of inner potential that do not stabilize into determinate meaning (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025a).

At the other end of the gradient are **expressive collapses**: structured, model‑dependent commitments that produce a trace in the shared world. Expressive collapse requires a unique recognition of meaning and results in a stable, externalized form, such as a spoken word, a musical note, a gesture, or any deliberate act of expression.

Collapse is therefore not separate from articulation; it is the point at which articulation becomes finalized, irreversible, and publicly available.

UPC formalizes collapse at this expressive level, where meaning becomes materially real for others. Micro‑collapses remain below the threshold of determinate expression and do not enter the shared world as traces (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025a, 2025b).

---

### Clarification

UPC formalizes collapse at the expressive level, where meaning becomes materially real for others. Micro‑collapses remain below the threshold of determinate expression and do not enter the shared world as traces.

For measurement and modeling purposes, UPC distinguishes articulation and collapse as two conditions, while in lived experience they form a **continuous gradient** of the same underlying movement from potential into form (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025a, 2025b).

### 6.2 Postulates

**UPC Postulate C1 (Definition).**  
Expressive collapse is a function  


\[
C : (E_O, M) \rightarrow \{0,1\}
\]

  
mapping an expression‑ready form and a model to a binary collapse outcome.  
C = 1 indicates that collapse has occurred; C = 0 indicates that it has not.

**UPC Postulate C2 (Recognition requirement).**  
Collapse occurs if and only if recognition selects exactly one determinate meaning.  
Without a uniquely recognized meaning, expressive collapse cannot occur.

**UPC Postulate C3 (Expression and Trace).**  
When expressive collapse occurs (C = 1), it produces a material trace in the shared world.  
This trace is the committed, externalized form of the articulated meaning.

**UPC Postulate C4 (Irreversibility).**  
Once collapse occurs, the resulting trace cannot be undone.  
It persists independently of the Observer’s inner state and becomes available to other Observers.

**UPC Postulate C5 (Model‑dependence).**  
Collapse depends on the model used for articulation.  
Different models may yield different collapse conditions and different forms of trace.

**UPC Postulate C6 (Gradient of Collapse).**  
Human embodiment produces continuous micro‑collapses—subtle materializations of inner potential that do not require unique recognition and do not produce stable traces.  
UPC formally models only expressive collapse, the threshold at which articulation becomes a determinate, shareable trace.

---

## 7. The UPC Axiom

The entire structure is summarized by the UPC axiom:



\[
C(A_{\text{expressive}}(m, M), M) = 1 \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \exists! J^{o}
\]



Meaning becomes materially real—collapse occurs—**if and only if** the Observer uniquely recognizes one meaning from the field of potential and articulates it through a model into an expression‑ready form.

---

## Summary Table

| Role        | Operator Sequence     | Collapse?     | Output      | Meaning Status                     |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Performer   | J → A → C → T         | Yes (C)       | Trace (T)   | Articulated but not fixed          |
| Listener    | T → L → R             | No            | —           | Re‑potentialized inner state; open |
| Community   | T → G                 | No (interpretive) | —       | Imposed meaning; not intrinsic     |

---

With the formal structure of UPC established, we can now examine how it operates within a concrete experiential domain. **Music is uniquely suited for this purpose:** it produces traces that articulate expression without fixing meaning, and it engages listeners in a continuous movement between potential and collapse (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). By applying UPC to musical performance and listening, we can clarify how musical experience unfolds within consciousness and why music occupies a distinctive position among expressive forms.

---

# Why Music Mirrors Consciousness

Music mirrors consciousness because it preserves the openness of meaning that characterizes the inner world. Linguistic communication collapses meaning into tightly fixed coordinates—words, definitions, categories, social references, and identity implications. A sentence narrows interpretation by forcing the Observer to commit to a specific semantic path. Words are rigid collapses: they require the listener to judge, decode, and select from a constrained set of meanings (Wittgenstein, 1953).

Music does not impose this structure. Musical expression, especially instrumental music, enters the material world as a collapse that still retains the fluidity of potential. It offers form without forcing a single interpretation (Scruton, 1997; Kivy, 1989; Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983). The listener encounters sound that is shaped but not semantically fixed, structured but not conceptually bound. Meaning remains open, dynamic, and internally generated.

In this way, music resembles the inner state of consciousness itself. Internally, we experience possibilities before they collapse into action or speech. Thoughts, feelings, and images arise as potentials—fluid, shifting, and uncommitted (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). Instrumental music reflects this same structure: it presents a field of expressive possibilities that the Observer navigates without being required to collapse them into determinate meaning. Listening becomes a direct analogue of inner experience: potential is perceived, but expression remains open.

---

# Formal UPC Claim: Why Music Mirrors Consciousness

We model consciousness in UPC as the domain of inner potential and recognition.

### Inner potential of an Observer


\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle \in P_O
\]

  
where \(P_O\) contains multiple possible meanings that are not yet collapsed.

### Recognition (inner determinacy)


\[
J^{o} : P_O \rightarrow M_O
\]

  


\[
J^{o}(\lvert \Psi \rangle) = m
\]



Consciousness, in its potential phase, is characterized by:

- multiplicity of possible meanings inside ∣Ψ⟩  
- lack of enforced external collapse into a single outward form  
- inner navigation of meanings without necessary expression  

---

## 1. Musical expression as collapse

A musical work (or performance) by Observer \(O_c\) is a collapse.

**Composer/performer’s inner potential**  


\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_c} \in P_{O_c}
\]



**Recognition into musical meaning**  


\[
J^{o}_{c}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_c}) = m_{O_c}
\]



**Articulation into musical form**  


\[
A_{\text{expressive}}(m_{O_c}, M_{\text{music}}) = e_{\text{music}}
\]



**Collapse into a musical trace**  


\[
C(e_{\text{music}}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



Thus music is a material trace \(T_{\text{music}}\) generated by collapse under a specifically musical model \(M_{\text{music}}\).

---

## 2. Musical trace as structured potential for the listener

For a listener \(O_L\), the musical trace is input:



\[
T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



The listener reconstructs an inner potential state from this trace via a propagation/interpretation mapping:



\[
P_{\text{music}} : W \times M_{O_L} \rightarrow P_{O_L}
\]





\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L} = P_{\text{music}}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L})
\]



### Non‑semantic openness

For musical traces (especially instrumental), the induced state is rich in possible meanings with no single semantically fixed coordinate forced by the trace.

Formally:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L}
\]



such that



\[
\#\{ m \in M_{O_L} : J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}) = m \} \text{ is large}
\]



and often:



\[
\neg \exists! J^{o}_{L} \text{ with } s(J^{o}_{L}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}) \gg 0
\]



In words: the musical trace induces a highly superposed inner potential state in the listener, with many viable recognitions and no forced unique interpretation.

---

## 3. Contrast with linguistic collapse

For linguistic expressions under a linguistic model \(M_{\text{lang}}\):



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{lang}}_{O_L} = P_{\text{lang}}(T_{\text{lang}}, M_{\text{lang}}, M_{O_L})
\]



Language tends toward unique recognition:



\[
\exists! J^{o}_{L,\text{lang}} \text{ such that } s(J^{o}_{L,\text{lang}}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{lang}}_{O_L}) = \max_i s(J^{o}_{L,i}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{lang}}_{O_L})
\]



---

## 4. Formal statement of mirroring

Let:

- \(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{\text{inner}} \in P_O\) be the Observer’s inner potential during non‑collapsed consciousness  
- \(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}\) be the state induced by a musical trace \(T_{\text{music}}\)

Music mirrors consciousness when:

### Structural equivalence of potential


\[
\text{Struct}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}) \approx \text{Struct}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{\text{inner}})
\]



### Non‑enforced collapse


\[
\neg \left( \exists! J^{o}_{L} \text{ such that } C(A_{\text{expressive}}(J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}), M_{O_L}), M_{O_L}) = 1 \text{ is required by } T_{\text{music}} \right)
\]



The musical trace does not itself demand a unique collapse into a specific semantic content.

### Potential‑Dominant Experience



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}
\]



is maintained as **potential** over time, with  


\[
C = 0
\]

  
for most moments of listening.

---

## Conclusion

Music mirrors consciousness in UPC because:

- it induces in the listener an inner potential state  
- whose structure, multiplicity, fluidity, openness, and non‑commitment  
- is isomorphic (in relevant respects) to the Observer’s own pre‑expressive, pre‑collapsed inner world.

---

# Why Instrumental Music Is Pure Potential

Instrumental music is pure potential because it collapses meaning into the material world **without fixing that meaning for any Observer** (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

When a performer expresses through an instrument, they draw from their irreducible inner world—their memories, emotions, sensations, and intuitions. Through recognition and articulation, they collapse this inner potential into sound. The performer may attribute personal meaning to the expression, but that meaning does not transfer directly. It remains private, bound to the performer’s own model and recognition operators (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025c).

Once the musical trace enters the shared world, it **reopens into potential** for every listener. The sound is structured but not semantically anchored; it offers form without prescribing interpretation (Scruton, 1997; Kivy, 1989). Each Observer reconstructs meaning through their own inner world, guided by their own models, histories, and recognition patterns. The same phrase, chord, or timbre can evoke entirely different meanings in different listeners—or even in the same listener at different times.

Instrumental music is therefore a unique kind of collapse: one that produces a structured material trace while **preserving the openness of potential**. Other domains—visual art, poetry, natural landscapes—may approximate this structure, but music is the clearest and most complete example of expression that remains fluid, dynamic, and internally generated for every Observer (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

The listener receives not a message but a **field of possibilities**. Meaning arises internally, not from decoding but from resonance. In this way, instrumental music behaves like the inner world behaves: fluid, shifting, and irreducible. It is a collapsed form that remains potential (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

---

# Formal UPC Claim: Instrumental Music as Pure Potential

We consider two roles:

- **Performer (composer or improviser):** \(O_P\)  
- **Listener:** \(O_L\)

and a specifically musical model \(M_{\text{music}}\).

---

## 1. Performer Side: Musical Trace as Collapse

**The performer’s inner state:**



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P} \in P_{O_P}
\]



**Recognition of a musical meaning:**



\[
J^{o}_{P}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P}) = m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]



**Articulation through the musical model:**



\[
A(m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]



**Collapse into a musical trace:**



\[
C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



Here, \(T_{\text{music}}\) is the instrumental musical trace (sound pattern, notation, recording)—a collapsed, structured expression.

**Private meaning (not encoded in the trace):**



\[
\mu_{O_P} = J^{o}_{P,\text{meta}}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P})
\]



But:



\[
\neg \exists F_{\text{sem}} \text{ such that } F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{\text{music}}) = \mu_{O_P}
\]



There is **no function** that extracts the performer’s inner meaning as fixed semantic content from the trace alone.

---

## 2. Listener Side: Musical Trace Re‑Opening Into Potential

For a listener \(O_L\), the musical trace is input:



\[
T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



The listener’s model (musical enculturation, biography, etc.) is \(M_{O_L}\).

The trace induces a listener potential state:



\[
P_{\text{music}} : W \times M_{O_L} \rightarrow P_{O_L}
\]





\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L} = P_{\text{music}}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L})
\]



### Key property of instrumental music



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L} \text{ is large}
\]



and typically:



\[
\#\{ m \in M_{O_L} : s(J^{o}_{L,m}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}) > 0 \} \text{ is large}
\]



In words:  
The musical trace induces a **highly superposed** inner potential state in the listener, with many viable recognitions and **no forced, uniquely dominant semantic meaning**.

---

## 3. Purity of Potential: No Determinate Semantic Coordinate

We distinguish **structural form** from **semantic fixation**.

### Structural form (determinate)



\[
\text{Struct}(T_{\text{music}}) = f_{\text{music}}(M_{\text{music}})
\]



Structure includes rhythm, contour, harmony, timbre, etc.

### Semantic content (underdetermined)



\[
\neg \exists! \sigma \in \Sigma \text{ such that } \forall O_L: J^{o}_{L,\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}) = \sigma
\]



Thus, instrumental music is:

- structurally determinate  
- semantically underdetermined  

---

## 4. Formal Statement of “Pure Potential”

**UPC Claim (Instrumental music as pure potential).**  
Let \(T_{\text{music}}\) be an instrumental musical trace generated by an Observer \(O_P\) under a musical model \(M_{\text{music}}\). For any listener \(O_L\):

### 1. Re‑opening into potential



\[
T_{\text{music}} \xrightarrow[]{P_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L}} \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L}
\]



The collapsed trace induces a **new inner potential state** in the listener.

### 2. Multiplicity of meanings



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L} \text{ supports many possible recognitions with comparable strength}
\]



### 3. No enforced unique recognition



\[
\neg \exists! J^{o}_{L} \text{ such that } C(A(J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{music}}_{O_L}), M_{O_L}), M_{O_L}) = 1 \text{ is prescribed by } T_{\text{music}}
\]



---

## Therefore

Instrumental music is **pure potential** in the sense that:

- it is a collapsed, structured expression in the material world  
- which, for each listener, re‑enters the inner domain as a state of rich, non‑fixed potential  
- with meaning arising internally rather than being semantically dictated by the trace  

# Why Listening Is Non‑Collapse

Listening to music is not a collapse event for the Observer, even though the sound itself is already collapsed into the material world (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). The performer has made choices—what notes to play, how to shape them, how to articulate and phrase them—and those choices constitute a collapse from the performer’s inner world into a musical trace (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025c). But for the listener, that trace does not enforce a determinate meaning. It arrives as structured sound without semantic obligation.

Music mirrors the non‑judgmental openness of the inner world. When listening, the Observer encounters a signal that is already material yet remains fluid in meaning. The listener may choose to interpret, or may simply feel and sense without committing to any specific recognition. The musical trace offers possibilities without requiring the Observer to select one. It is a collapse that does not demand a reciprocal collapse in the listener (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b; Zatorre, Chen, & Penhune, 2007).

Thus, listening is a layered experience: the performer collapses meaning into sound, but the listener receives that sound as potential. The material trace is fixed, but its meaning is not. The listener remains in a state of inner openness, navigating possibilities without being forced into a single interpretation. In this way, listening to music preserves the structure of non‑collapse that characterizes the inner irreducible world of the Observer (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

---

# Formal UPC Claim: Why Listening to Music Is Non‑Collapse

We keep the same actors and objects:

- **Performer:** \(O_P\)  
- **Listener:** \(O_L\)  
- **Musical model:** \(M_{\text{music}}\)  
- **Musical trace:** \(T_{\text{music}} \in W\)

From the performer’s side, as before:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P} \in P_{O_P}
\]





\[
J^{o}_{P}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P}) = m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]





\[
A(m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]





\[
C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \Rightarrow T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



So for the performer, music **is** a collapse event.

---

## 1. Listening as Induction of Inner Potential

Define a listening operator for the listener:



\[
L_{O_L} : W \times M_{O_L} \rightarrow P_{O_L}
\]



For a given musical trace:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} = L_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L})
\]



This \(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}\) is the inner potential state induced by listening.

**Key property:**



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L}, \quad \text{not in } W
\]



Listening moves from **material trace back into inner potential**, not into outward expression.

---

## 2. Non‑Requirement of Collapse While Listening

For the listener, collapse would mean:



\[
C(A(J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}), M_{O_L}), M_{O_L}) = 1
\]



i.e., the listener recognizes a determinate meaning, articulates it, and expresses it (speech, gesture, action, etc.).

The crucial claim:



\[
\forall T_{\text{music}}, \forall O_L: \text{listening itself does not entail collapse}
\]



Or:



\[
\forall T_{\text{music}}, \forall O_L: \text{if State = listening, then } C_{\text{listen}} = 0
\]



More formally:



\[
\forall T_{\text{music}}, \forall O_L: (\text{State = listening}) \Rightarrow C(A(J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}), M_{O_L}), M_{O_L}) \in \{0, \text{optional}\}
\]



Where **optional** means collapse may occur only if the listener chooses to speak, move, or act—but it is not required by listening itself.

In other words:

- Listening creates inner potential.  
- It does **not** require outward expression.

---

## 3. Preservation of Openness During Listening

The induced state has many viable recognitions:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} = L_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L})
\]



such that:



\[
\#\{ m \in M_{O_L} : s(J^{o}_{L,m}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}) > 0 \} \text{ is large}
\]



and typically:



\[
\neg \exists! m^{*} \in M_{O_L} \text{ such that } s(J^{o}_{L,m^{*}}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}) \gg s(J^{o}_{L,m}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L})
\]



Thus:

- many possible inner recognitions are available  
- none is forced into dominance by the musical trace  
- no outward collapse is structurally required  

---

## 4. Formal Statement of the Claim

**UPC Claim (Listening to music as non‑collapse).**  
Let \(T_{\text{music}}\) be a musical trace in the material world, generated by some Observer \(O_P\). For any listening Observer \(O_L\):

1. **Listening induces an inner potential state, not a material expression:**



\[
L_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L}) = \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L}
\]



2. **This state maintains multiple viable internal recognitions with no uniquely enforced meaning.**

3. **The act of listening does not entail:**



\[
C(A_{\text{expressive}}(J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}), M_{O_L}), M_{O_L}) = 1
\]



Thus, within UPC, listening to music is a **non‑collapse** event for the Observer: the musical trace is collapsed, but the listener’s engagement remains in the domain of inner potential, mirroring the non‑judgmental openness of the inner world (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

---

In the case of a listener not attaching specific memories, judgments, or narrative interpretations to the musical trace, the induced state remains entirely within inner potential. The listener may experience emotions, sensations, or associative drift, but none of these constitute a determinate recognition or outward articulation (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

However, even so, while listening, emotions and sensations are the first material echoes expressed in the body—collapsed into the material as subtle physiological responses—yet they do not amount to a full cognitive or expressive collapse (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025a).

It is important to note that collapse potential is present and constant on many levels, because to exist is to have body and consciousness continuously linking the material with the irreducible. The scope here is music and Observer relationships, and within this scope, listening remains fundamentally an openness rather than a forced collapse (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

# Why Performance Is Collapse

For me as a musician, performance has always been the moment where inner potential becomes material (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). As a teenager, music was the bridge to thoughts and feelings I could not yet articulate through language. My linguistic tools were still developing, and social pressures—expectations of proper behavior, fear of judgment, the need to say the “right” thing—made direct expression feel risky or constrained. Music offered a different path. It allowed me to explore and rehearse inner possibilities without committing them to the world. Sound became a private language of potential (Small, 1998).

As I learned guitar, began writing songs, and eventually performed and recorded music, each piece became a deliberate collapse of an inner moment into the material world (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025c). A song was a snapshot of a feeling, a memory, or an experience—captured and shaped, yet still open enough to preserve the vastness of the inner world it came from. Music let me express without over‑specifying. It bypassed the rigid verdicts that direct language often forces (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

When lyrics entered the picture, they acted as linguistic coordinates, but the music surrounding them softened and expanded their meaning (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). The emotional contour of sound supported the words, giving them depth and nuance that pure language cannot reliably carry. In everyday conversation, listeners must constantly interpret intent: *Are they joking? Are they hiding something? Are they judging me? Is this a challenge?* But in music, the emotional frame is already present. The listener does not need to decode social ambiguity; the sound itself carries the emotional truth of the expression (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

From the performer’s perspective, writing, recording, and performing music is the act of collapsing inner potential into a fixed trace—choosing notes, shaping phrases, committing to a form. It is the moment where the irreducible inner world becomes material. **Performance is collapse** (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

---

# Formal UPC Claim: Why Performance Is Collapse

We consider the performer \(O_P\), their inner potential state, and the musical model \(M_{\text{music}}\).

---

## 1. Inner potential of the performer

The performer begins with an irreducible inner state:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P} \in P_{O_P}
\]



This state contains emotional, experiential, and intuitive potentials that are not yet articulated.

---

## 2. Recognition of a musical meaning

The performer selects or recognizes a musical meaning from this inner potential:



\[
J^{o}_{P}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P}) = m^{\text{music}}_{O_P} \in M_{O_P}
\]



This is the moment where the performer identifies “what the song is about” internally—the seed of expression.

---

## 3. Articulation into musical form

The performer shapes this meaning into a musical expression:



\[
A(m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]



This includes choosing notes, phrasing, harmony, rhythm, timbre, and emotional contour.

---

## 4. Collapse into the material world

Performance or recording commits the expression into the material world:



\[
C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \Rightarrow T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



Here, \(T_{\text{music}}\) is the musical trace—the fixed, material outcome of the performer’s choices.

This is the collapse event:

**inner potential → articulated expression → material trace**

---

## 5. Ambiguity preserved despite collapse

Even though the performer collapses meaning into the world, the trace does **not** encode the performer’s private meaning:



\[
\neg \exists F_{\text{sem}} \text{ such that } F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}) = \mu_{O_P}
\]



where \(\mu_{O_P}\) is the performer’s internal meaning.

Thus, **performance collapses structure, not semantic content**.

---

## 6. Formal statement of the claim

**UPC Claim (Performance as collapse).**  
Let \(O_P\) be a performer with inner potential state \(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P}\). Let \(M_{\text{music}}\) be the musical model. Then:

1. The performer recognizes a musical meaning:  
   

\[
   J^{o}_{P}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P}) = m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
   \]



2. The performer articulates this meaning into musical form:  
   

\[
   A(m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
   \]



3. Performance or recording collapses this articulation into the material world:  
   

\[
   C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \Rightarrow T_{\text{music}} \in W
   \]



Therefore, **performance is a collapse event**: the performer commits inner potential into a fixed material trace, even though the meaning remains open for listeners.

---

# Why Music Allows Collapse Without Semantic Fixation

Music lets an Observer collapse inner potential into the material world **without forcing the rigid semantic commitments** that ordinary language demands (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). In my own experience as a musician, music provided a way to express thoughts and feelings that I could not yet articulate through words. Language carried social pressures, expectations, and the risk of misinterpretation. Music did not. It allowed me to collapse inner states into sound while preserving the ambiguity and openness of the original experience (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

This does not mean music is always “safe” in the sense of being socially neutral. Music can be used to consolidate political movements, challenge norms, or rally collective identities. Listeners and communities can attach strong ideological meanings to songs, anthems, and performances. But even in these cases, the musical trace itself does not fix a single semantic verdict. It becomes a vessel that groups fill with shared meaning, not a linguistic statement that dictates its own interpretation (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

Thus, music occupies a unique position: it allows the performer to collapse inner potential into the world while avoiding the semantic rigidity of direct language. **The collapse is structural, not prescriptive.** The meaning remains open enough to bypass the interpersonal constraints that govern ordinary communication, even while the music may later be adopted, reinterpreted, or politicized by others (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

**Music collapses expression without collapsing meaning.**

---

# Formal UPC Claim: Why Music Allows Collapse Without Semantic Fixation

Let \(O_P\) be a performer, \(M_{\text{music}}\) the musical model, and \(T_{\text{music}}\) the resulting musical trace.

---

## 1. Collapse of inner potential into musical form

As before, the performer begins with an inner potential state:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P} \in P_{O_P}
\]



Recognition selects a musical meaning:



\[
J^{o}_{P}(\lvert \Psi \rangle_{O_P}) = m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]



Articulation shapes it into musical expression:



\[
A(m^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}
\]



Collapse commits it into the material world:



\[
C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \Rightarrow T_{\text{music}} \in W
\]



This is the performer’s collapse.

---

## 2. The musical trace does not fix semantic meaning

Define a semantic extraction function:



\[
F_{\text{sem}} : W \rightarrow M
\]



For ordinary language, \(F_{\text{sem}}\) is often close to injective: the linguistic trace strongly constrains meaning.

For music, we assert:



\[
\forall T_{\text{music}} \in W : F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}) \text{ is underdetermined}
\]



Formally:



\[
\neg \exists! \mu \in M \text{ such that } F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}) = \mu
\]



Meaning: **the musical trace does not enforce a single semantic verdict**.

---

## 3. Openness to reinterpretation by groups and movements

Even when a community assigns meaning to a musical trace, this assignment is external:



\[
\mu_{\text{group}} = G(T_{\text{music}})
\]



where \(G\) is a group‑level interpretive function.

Crucially:



\[
G(T_{\text{music}}) \neq F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}})
\]



because:

- \(G\) is contingent, historical, cultural  
- \(F_{\text{sem}}\) is intrinsic to the trace  

Thus:



\[
\mu_{\text{group}} \text{ is an imposed meaning, not a fixed meaning}
\]



This accounts for:

- political anthems  
- protest songs  
- cultural identity music  
- ideological reinterpretations  

without contradicting the openness of the musical trace itself.

---

## 4. Collapse without semantic fixation

We can now state the core structural property:



\[
C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \neg \exists! \mu \in M : F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}) = \mu
\]



This is the defining feature of musical collapse:

**Music collapses structure, not meaning.**

The performer commits to a form, but the meaning remains open, fluid, and reinterpretable.

---

## 5. Formal statement of the claim

**UPC Claim (Music allows collapse without semantic fixation).**  
Let \(O_P\) be a performer and \(T_{\text{music}}\) the musical trace produced by collapse. Then:

1. The performer collapses inner potential into a fixed material form:  
   

\[
   C(e^{\text{music}}_{O_P}, M_{\text{music}}) = 1 \Rightarrow T_{\text{music}} \in W
   \]



2. The musical trace does not determine a unique semantic meaning:  
   

\[
   \neg \exists! \mu \in M : F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}}) = \mu
   \]



3. Group‑level meanings are imposed, not intrinsic:  
   

\[
   G(T_{\text{music}}) \neq F_{\text{sem}}(T_{\text{music}})
   \]



Therefore, **music enables collapse into the material world without fixing semantic content**, allowing expression without the rigid commitments of direct language—even while remaining open to later cultural or political reinterpretation.

# Why Music Re‑Potentializes the Listener

Music re‑opens the listener’s inner world because it bypasses judgment. Unlike language, it does not demand interpretation or impose a fixed meaning. Instead, it enters the listener’s inner space without forcing a decision, allowing them to feel rather than evaluate (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). The musical trace resonates with the listener’s own inner states, activating potentials that may have no linguistic form. Its layered and ambiguous structure invites multiple possible recognitions, none of which must be chosen. In this way, music restores the listener to a state of inner openness, **re‑potentializing rather than collapsing** their experience.

---

# Formal UPC Claim: Why Music Re‑Potentializes the Listener

Let \(O_L\) be a listener, \(M_{O_L}\) their internal model, and \(T_{\text{music}}\) a musical trace in the material world.

---

## 1. The musical trace enters the listener without enforcing meaning

Listening applies the listening operator:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} = L_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L})
\]



This induced state satisfies:



\[
\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L}
\]



meaning the musical trace re‑enters the listener’s **inner potential space**, not their material expression space.

---

## 2. No forced recognition or semantic commitment

For collapse to occur, the listener would need:



\[
C(A_{\text{expressive}}(J^{o}_{L}(\lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}), M_{O_L}), M_{O_L}) = 1
\]



But music does **not** require this. Formally:



\[
\forall T_{\text{music}}, \forall O_L : C_{\text{listen}} = 0
\]



unless the listener voluntarily chooses to articulate or express something.

Thus:

**Listening ⇒ no required collapse**

---

## 3. Music activates multiple viable inner recognitions

The induced potential state supports many possible recognitions:



\[
\#\{ m \in M_{O_L} : s(J^{o}_{L,m}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}) > 0 \} \text{ is large}
\]



and typically:



\[
\neg \exists! m^{*} \in M_{O_L} : s(J^{o}_{L,m^{*}}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}) \gg s(J^{o}_{L,m}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L})
\]



This captures:

- ambiguity  
- layered structure  
- emotional resonance  
- non‑judgmental openness  

Music does not force the listener to decide; **it allows them to feel**.

---

## 4. Re‑potentialization as the structural effect of music

Define the re‑potentialization operator:



\[
R_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}) = L_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L})
\]



Then:



\[
R_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}) \in P_{O_L}
\]



This expresses the core claim:

**Music re‑potentializes the listener by transforming a collapsed trace back into inner potential.**

---

## 5. Formal statement of the claim

**UPC Claim (Music re‑potentializes the listener).**  
For any listener \(O_L\) and any musical trace \(T_{\text{music}}\):

1. **Listening induces an inner potential state:**

   

\[
   L_{O_L}(T_{\text{music}}, M_{O_L}) = \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L} \in P_{O_L}
   \]



2. **The musical trace does not enforce a unique recognition:**

   

\[
   \neg \exists! m^{*} \in M_{O_L} : s(J^{o}_{L,m^{*}}, \lvert \Psi \rangle^{\text{listen}}_{O_L}) \text{ dominates}
   \]



3. **Listening does not require collapse:**

   

\[
   C_{\text{listen}} = 0
   \]



Therefore, **music re‑opens the listener’s inner world**, restoring them to a state of potential rather than forcing a determinate interpretation.

# Implications

This framework suggests that music is more than an art form—it is a structural expression of how consciousness itself works. Because music collapses inner potential into the world without fixing a single meaning, it offers a model of communication that preserves openness rather than forcing interpretation (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b). This helps explain why music can carry emotional truth even when words fail, and why listeners can find their own experiences reflected in the same piece of music across different moments in their lives (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b, 2025c).

The performer–listener asymmetry also clarifies why music can support both personal expression and collective identity. A performer collapses a private inner state into sound, but the listener re‑opens that sound into their own potential. This allows music to move fluidly between individual and group meaning. It can become deeply personal for one listener, while also serving as a shared symbol for a community, movement, or culture. The musical trace does not dictate these meanings; it simply provides a structure that others can inhabit.

More broadly, this model shows that not all communication needs to be semantically rigid. Music demonstrates a form of expression where clarity does not require precision, and where resonance does not depend on agreement. It reveals a mode of understanding grounded in openness rather than judgment, and in potential rather than verdict. In this way, music offers insight into how humans can share inner experience without collapsing it into fixed categories—an implication that reaches beyond music into the wider study of consciousness, expression, and human connection (Escagedo Gutierrez, 2025b).

# Limitations

UPC is a structural framework for modeling the relationship between inner potential, recognition, articulation, and collapse. It does **not** describe neural mechanisms, acoustic physics, or cultural histories of music, nor does it claim that musical meaning is universal or that all listeners experience music in the same way. UPC does not provide a semantic decoder for musical traces, and it does not model physical measurement or quantum collapse. Its focus is the structure of experience itself: how expression emerges from potential, and how music uniquely re‑enters potential without enforcing a single interpretation.

This account addresses musical experience at the level of consciousness rather than the mechanics of sound, culture, or neuroscience. While UPC models how music interacts with potential and collapse, it does not attempt to capture every cultural or historical context in which music appears. The openness of musical meaning does not prevent strong interpretations from forming within communities or ideologies; it simply holds that such meanings are imposed rather than intrinsic. Questions about neural implementation, developmental factors, and cross‑modal artistic forms remain outside the present scope.

# Conclusion

This paper has shown that music offers a unique window into the structure of consciousness. Through the lens of UPC, we can see how performance collapses inner potential into the material world, while listening re‑opens that trace into new potential within the listener. Music expresses without over‑specifying, communicates without forcing interpretation, and resonates without demanding agreement. It mirrors the inner world precisely because it preserves openness even as it takes form. In this way, music becomes a model for how consciousness can share itself without losing its irreducible depth.

# Future Directions

This framework invites several avenues for further exploration. One direction is to extend UPC to other non‑linguistic forms of expression—dance, abstract art, ritual, or gesture—to see whether they share music’s capacity for collapse without semantic fixation. Another is to examine collective musical experiences, such as concerts or communal singing, where individual and group potential interact in real time. Finally, this model may offer insight into therapeutic or psychological contexts, where music’s ability to re‑potentialize experience plays a central role.

These directions suggest that the relationship between collapse, potential, and expression reaches far beyond music, offering a broader foundation for understanding how humans communicate inner life.
